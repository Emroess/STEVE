## Testing and Quality Assurance

### We Need Your Help Finding Bugs

While STEVE has been developed with careful attention to quality and reliability, real-world testing across diverse use cases is invaluable. We encourage you to thoroughly exercise both the firmware and client software:

**Firmware Testing**
- Test all CLI commands and parameter ranges
- Explore edge cases in haptic control (rapid preset changes, boundary conditions)
- Verify network stability under various conditions
- Stress-test the motor control loop with challenging scenarios
- Validate CAN bus communication reliability with the ODrive

**Client Software Testing**
- Exercise the Python client library (`pysteve`) with your workflows
- Test REST API endpoints from different languages and frameworks
- Verify streaming performance with high data rates
- Test integration with robotics frameworks (ROS 2, Isaac Sim, MuJoCo)
- Explore compatibility across different operating systems

**How to Report Issues**

If you discover bugs or unexpected behavior:
1. Document the steps to reproduce the issue
2. Note your hardware and software configuration
3. Include relevant logs and error messages
4. Share your findings with the development team

Your bug reports help make STEVE better for everyone!

## Future Development Directions

### 1. Advanced Motor Control: Moving FOC to STM32H7

**Current Architecture:**
STEVE currently uses an ODrive S1 motor controller for Field-Oriented Control (FOC) of the brushless motor. The valve control loop runs on the STM32H753ZI and communicates with the ODrive via CAN bus.

**Future Opportunity:**
One of the most promising areas for enhancement is moving the FOC motor control loop directly onto the STM32H753ZI:

**Potential Benefits:**
- **Reduced Latency** - Eliminate CAN bus communication delay between valve control and motor control
- **Tighter Integration** - Direct coupling of haptic algorithms with motor commutation
- **Higher Control Rates** - Potential for faster update rates in both loops
- **Simplified Hardware** - Reduce external components and wiring complexity
- **Focus** - Single-board solution with fewer components

**Potential Risks:**
- **Complexity** - Taking responsibility for the FOC motor control loop requires significant firmware expansion.

**Technical Considerations:**
- The STM32H753ZI has sufficient processing power (480 MHz Cortex-M7)
- Hardware support for motor control peripherals (timers, ADCs, comparators)
- CMSIS-DSP library provides optimized math operations
- Opportunity to explore advanced control strategies

**Research Questions:**
- What performance improvements are achievable?
- How does direct motor control affect haptic fidelity?
- Can we push control rates beyond current capabilities?
- What are the implications for stability and passivity?

This represents an exciting area for experimentation and could significantly enhance STEVE's performance characteristics. We welcome collaboration from engineers interested in motor control and real-time embedded systems!

### 2. Touchscreen Interface for Preset Selection

**Current Interfaces:**
STEVE provides multiple control interfaces:
- CLI over USB serial
- REST API over Ethernet
- Web-based control panel
- TCP data streaming

**Future Addition: Touchscreen Display**

For users who prefer direct physical interaction, a touchscreen interface could provide:

**Features:**
- **Quick Preset Selection** - Touch buttons for common valve configurations
- **Live Parameter Adjustment** - Sliders for damping, friction, stiffness
- **Real-Time Visualization** - Graphs of position, velocity, and torque
- **Simulation Control** - Start/stop, enable/disable, emergency stop
- **Status Display** - System health, network connectivity, motor status

**Use Cases:**
- Laboratory demonstrations and hands-on exploration
- Quick setup without computer connection
- Training and educational scenarios
- Stand-alone operation in field environments

**Implementation Options:**
- SPI/I2C touchscreen LCD connected to STM32H7
- Dedicated UI processor (ESP32) communicating via UART or CAN
- Tablet/smartphone app using REST API (software-only solution)

**Community Input Needed:**
We recognize that many robotics engineers prefer programmatic API control for automated testing and integration with larger systems. A touchscreen interface may appeal to different use cases - perhaps educational settings, demonstrations, or manual tuning sessions.

We'd love to hear from you: What features would be most useful? Let us know!

### 3. Enhanced Data Logging and Visualization

**Current Capabilities:**
STEVE currently supports real-time data streaming over TCP, enabling external data logging and visualization tools.

**Future Enhancements:**

**On-Device Data Logging:**
- Store haptic session data directly to SD card or flash memory
- Timestamped logs with position, velocity, torque, and system state
- Configurable sampling rates and triggered recording
- Export in standard formats (CSV, HDF5, JSON)

**Web-Based Visualization Dashboard:**
- Enhanced web interface with historical data plots
- Multi-channel waveform display and analysis
- Spectral analysis and frequency domain views
- Session playback and comparison tools
- Export and sharing capabilities

**Cloud Integration:**
- Optional data upload for long-term storage
- Multi-device fleet management
- Aggregate analysis across experiments
- Collaborative research workflows

**Analytics and Insights:**
- Automatic detection of events and anomalies
- Performance metrics and statistics
- Comparative analysis between presets
- System health monitoring and diagnostics

**Ethernet Advantages:**
The decision to include Ethernet connectivity opens many possibilities:
- High-bandwidth data transfer
- Integration with network storage (NAS, databases)
- Web-based interfaces accessible from any device
- Support for multiple simultaneous users and observers
- Remote monitoring and control capabilities

We're excited to explore how enhanced data capabilities can support research, debugging, and system optimization. Your feedback on priority features would be invaluable!
