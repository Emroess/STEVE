## What You'll Need

### Hardware
- **STEVE Device** - STM32 Nucleo-H753ZI development board with firmware
- **USB Cable** - Standard USB Type-B or Micro-USB cable
- **Computer** - Windows, Mac, or Linux PC

### Software
- **Serial Terminal** - One of the following:
  - Windows: PuTTY, TeraTerm, or Windows Terminal
  - Mac/Linux: screen, minicom, or CoolTerm
  - Cross-platform: Arduino IDE Serial Monitor

### Optional
- **ODrive Motor Controller** - Connected via CAN bus for haptic control
- **Ethernet Cable** - For network features (web interface, streaming)

---

## Connecting to STEVE

### Physical Connection

1. **Locate the ST-LINK USB port** on your Nucleo-H753ZI board
   - This is typically the USB connector closest to the Ethernet port
   - Labeled "USB ST-LINK" or "CN1" on the board

2. **Connect the USB cable** between your computer and the ST-LINK port

3. **Power up the board**
   - The board is powered through the USB connection
   - You should see LED indicators light up
   - Green LED typically indicates normal operation

4. **Wait for driver installation** (first time only)
   - Windows: ST-LINK drivers install automatically
   - Mac/Linux: Usually works without additional drivers

### Identifying the Serial Port

**Windows:**
- Open Device Manager (Win+X, then Device Manager)
- Look under "Ports (COM & LPT)"
- Find "STMicroelectronics STLink Virtual COM Port (COMx)"
- Note the COM port number (e.g., COM3, COM7)

**Mac:**
- Open Terminal
- Run: `ls /dev/tty.usbmodem*`
- The device will be something like `/dev/tty.usbmodem1234`

**Linux:**
- Open Terminal
- Run: `ls /dev/ttyACM*`
- The device will be something like `/dev/ttyACM0`

## First Commands

### Verify Connection

After connecting, you should see a welcome message:
```
Type 'help' for available commands
> 
```

The `>` symbol is the command prompt. If you don't see it, press Enter.

### Get Help

Type `help` and press Enter to see all available commands:

```
> help

Available commands:
  can_encoder - Read CAN encoder position and velocity
  can_status - Show CAN bus status
  can_telemetry - Read CAN bus voltage, current, and temperatures
  eth_stream - Start/stop Ethernet data streaming
  ethstatus - Show Ethernet status and configuration
  help - Show this help
  odrive_enable - Enable ODrive closed loop control
  valve_start - Start valve control

## Basic Operation Workflow

Here's a typical sequence for starting up the valve control system:

### 1. Check ODrive Connection

```
> odrive_ping

ODrive heartbeat received
Node ID: 0
Axis state: IDLE
```

### 2. Calibrate ODrive (if needed)

```
> odrive_calibrate

ODrive calibration started
Note: Motor will move during calibration
```

Wait for calibration to complete (a few seconds).

### 3. Enable ODrive

```
> odrive_enable

ODrive enabled
```

### 4. Load a Preset (optional)

```
> valve_preset default

Loaded preset: default
```

### 5. Start Valve Control

```
> valve_start

Valve started
```

### 6. Monitor Status

```
> valve_status

Valve Status:
Position:    1234 counts (45.2 deg)
Velocity:    567 counts/s (20.8 deg/s)
Torque:      0.123 N·m
State:       RUNNING
```

### 7. Stop When Finished

```
> valve_stop

Valve stopped

> odrive_disable

ODrive disabled
```

## Common Tasks

### Adjusting Feel

Change the haptic characteristics in real-time:

**Make it smoother:**
```
> valve_damping 0.02
> valve_friction 0.005
```

**Make it stiffer:**
```
> valve_damping 0.1
> valve_friction 0.02
```

**Adjust wall boundaries:**
```
> valve_wall_k 2.0
> valve_wall_c 0.2
```

### Saving Your Configuration

Once you have settings you like:

```
> valve_preset_save myconfig

Preset saved: myconfig
```

Load it later:
```
> valve_preset myconfig

Loaded preset: myconfig
```

### Viewing All Presets

See what configurations are available:

```
> valve_preset_show

Available Presets:
[default]
  damping: 0.050
  friction: 0.010
  wall_k: 1.000
  wall_c: 0.100
[myconfig]
  damping: 0.020
  friction: 0.005
  ...
```

### Network Configuration

Set a static IP address:

```
> setip 192.168.1.150 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.1

IP configuration updated
```

Start the web interface:

```
> http start

HTTP server started (port 8080)
```

Then open a browser to: `http://192.168.1.150:8080`

### Data Logging

Start streaming data for analysis:

```
> eth_stream start 50

Ethernet streaming started (port 8888)
```

Connect with a client application to port 8888 to receive real-time data.

Or export recorded data:

```
> perf_dump

time_ms,position_deg,velocity_deg_s,torque_nm
0,0.0,0.0,0.0
10,0.5,2.3,0.012
...
```

Copy and paste this data into Excel or your analysis tool.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Connect to Serial Port

**Problem:** No response when typing commands

**Solutions:**
1. Verify USB cable is connected firmly
2. Check you have the correct COM port / device name
3. Confirm baud rate is 115200
4. Try unplugging and replugging the USB cable
5. Close other programs that might be using the serial port
6. On Linux, ensure you're in the dialout group

### ODrive Not Responding

**Problem:** `odrive_ping` shows no response

**Solutions:**
1. Check CAN bus wiring (CAN_H, CAN_L, GND)
2. Verify CAN termination resistors (120Ω on each end)
3. Ensure ODrive is powered on
4. Check ODrive node ID matches firmware configuration (typically 0)
5. Verify CAN bus bitrate matches (typically 1 Mbps)

### Valve Control Won't Start

**Problem:** `valve_start` fails with error

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure ODrive is enabled first: `odrive_enable`
2. Clear any ODrive errors: `odrive_clear`
3. Check ODrive mode is correct: `odrive_mode 1` (torque control)
4. Verify no hard faults: `fault_last`
5. Check ODrive status: `odrive_status`

### Commands Not Working

**Problem:** Commands not recognized or producing errors

**Solutions:**
1. Check spelling (commands are case-sensitive, all lowercase)
2. Ensure proper number of arguments
3. Type `help` to see correct command list
4. Press Enter after typing command
5. Try power cycling the board

### Network Not Connecting

**Problem:** Can't access web interface or streaming

**Solutions:**
1. Check Ethernet cable is connected
2. Verify IP address with `ethstatus`
3. Ensure computer is on same subnet
4. Try pinging the device from your computer
5. Reconfigure IP if needed with `setip`
6. Check if HTTP server is started: `http status`

### Motor Oscillating or Unstable

**Problem:** Motor vibrates or behaves erratically

**Solutions:**
1. Reduce damping: `valve_damping 0.03`
2. Lower torque limit: `valve_torquelimit 0.3`
3. Check ODrive gains aren't too high
4. Ensure motor is properly mounted and not mechanically bound
5. Verify encoder is working: `can_encoder`

### Need to Reset

**Problem:** System in bad state

**Solutions:**
1. Stop valve control: `valve_stop`
2. Disable ODrive: `odrive_disable`
3. Emergency stop if needed: `odrive_estop`
4. Clear errors: `odrive_clear`
5. Power cycle the entire system
6. Check for hard faults: `fault_last`
